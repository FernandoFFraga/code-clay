# Goal
<p>Code-clay is a set of ready-made tools and solutions for recurring tasks in building web applications with PHP.</p>
<p>All tools are designed to ease the programmer's workflow and add an extra abstraction level.</p>
<p>The tools have a communication interface between them, but they work independently. Similar to LEGO blocks!</p>

# Introduction

<p>All tools work independently, for that reason, to begin, you just have to download the individual tools you going to use.</p>
<p>Each of the tools has an individual documentation file that will contain all the information about the requirements and the mode of operation.</p>

<b><i>Note: We recommend using namespaces in conjunction with autoload according to PSR-4</i></b>
